    bio: |
      My name is Jan Troják, I am a student of the Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Information Technology. At the University I used to study inflrmational security during my batchelores degree. On magister programe I transitioned to Computer Systems and Networks. <br /> <br />
      Among my studies I am linux and opensource enthusiast. At the moment i focuse mailny on infrastructure, DevOps and security of IT systems. I like the infrastructure part, because usualy its the glue that holds projects and products together - which brings value and projects to the live. <br /> <br />
      Among IT I really like country side and all it brings like manual work on a garden, hiking, cycling and other outdoor activities. My biggest hobby are summer camps, which I love to help organize and run.
